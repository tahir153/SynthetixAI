SynthetixAI is a tool designed to generate new images autonomously.
The primary motivation behind this project was the common issue faced by developers
who often run out of high-quality images needed to train their machine-learning models.
To address this, I utilized GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) technology.
GANs consist of two parts: one generates images, and the other evaluates them to ensure they look realistic.
